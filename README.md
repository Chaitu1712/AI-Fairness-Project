# AI-Fairness-Project

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into decision-making processes across various sectors, raising critical concerns regarding fairness and bias. Bias in AI can arise from multiple sources, including skewed training data, flawed algorithmic design, and systemic societal inequalities. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of existing bias mitigation techniques in AI, categorizing them into three main stages: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods. We evaluate these techniques based on their effectiveness, scalability, impact on model performance, and applicability to different types of AI models and datasets. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy, interpretability, and ethical implications
